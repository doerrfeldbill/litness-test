# litness-test ðŸŒ˜
The moon is pretty **lit**. But just how lit is it? This simple one page site uses an open API to visually represent the phases of the moon. I built it to demo an introductory lesson on practical API use cases. This is a personal project and not intended for commercial use.

## About
This website calls the Farmsense API to display moon data. The Farmsense API was the only free service I could find that had the moon phase and illumination data this app required, but unfortunately, it does not server over HTTPS. Thus, Github does not allow it to be called. It works fine when called locally, and I'm working on creating a seperate domain for it soon.  

## Disclaimer
This was made for fun on vacation and is not that great. Code is not elegant, it's just for sample purposes.
