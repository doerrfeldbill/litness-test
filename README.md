# litness-test ðŸŒ˜
The moon is pretty **lit**. But just how lit is it? This simple one page site uses an open API to visually represent the phases of the moon. I built it to demo an introductory lesson on practical API use cases. This is a personal project and not intended for commercial use.

## About
lintness-test calls the Farmsense API to display moon data. The Farmsense API was the only free service I could find that had free, useful moon phase and illumination data. Unfortunately, Farmsense does not serve over HTTPS. Thus, Github does not allow it to be called. The site works fine when called locally, and I'm working on creating a seperate domain for it soon.  

## Disclaimer
This was made for fun on vacation and is not that great. Code is not elegant, it's just for sample purposes.
