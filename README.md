# phase ðŸŒ˜
#### The moon is pretty *lit*. But just how lit is it?
This simple one page site visually represents the current phase of the moon. I built it to demo an introductory example of practical API use cases. [View it here](https://doerrfeldbill.github.io/phase/). *The sample site no longer functions due to API changes since programming this project.*

## About
**phase** calls the [Farmsense API](http://www.farmsense.net/api/) to display moon data. The Farmsense API is a free-to-use open API that returns useful moon phase and illumination data. After much research, it was the only free service I could find that returned the data I wanted. 

## How it Works
Given a unix timstamp, Farmsense returns information on the current moon phase, illumination percentage, and colloquial phase name.

Here is an example response:

````
{
Error: 0,
ErrorMsg: "success",
TargetDate: "59666674651",
Moon: [
"Hunter's/Harvest Moon"
],
Index: 7,
Age: 7.736128607400602,
Phase: "1st Quarter",
Distance: 383609.25,
Illumination: 0.54,
AngularDiameter: 0.5191693257750506,
DistanceToSun: 149535897.73231384,
SunAngularDiameter: 0.5333511907005148
}
````

Depending on what the API returns, the script loads different images to reflect the current moon phase and illumination percentage. I also added a little bit of my own scientific interpretation on how lit the moon is:

````
0% : Woah. The moon is srsly not lit.
0% - 10% : The moon is like, not lit at all.
10% - 20% : The moon is like, hardly lit.
20% - 30% : Ok yeah, the moon is barely lit.
30% - 40% : Have you seen the moon lately? It's only sorta lit.
40% - 50% : The moon's like almost halfway lit.
50% - 60% : Half dark and half lit... moon you're being so bipolar.
60% - 70% : Huh, the moon is kinda lit.
70% - 80% : The moon is pretty cool but not completely lit.
80% - 90% : Dope. The moon is like pretty lit.
90% - 100 : Dang, is that moon full? No, but it srsly lit tho.
100% : The moon is totally 100% lit.
